    <p>
      ngUI is a small project that gave me the opportunity to explore further
      Angular's routing capabilities, Directives and Lifecycle Hooks to make a
      component as reusable as possible.

      The goal was to experiment with different Angular's features combined with
      Sass to sharpen my Frontend skills while designing something colorful and
      fun in Figma.
