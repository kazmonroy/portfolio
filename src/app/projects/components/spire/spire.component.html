      Spire is a Star Wars inspired gear store. It is built with Next.js and
      deployed in Vercel. It integrates Sanity headless CMS to manage the
      store's content and Stripe as the payment solution.

      The Design System was customised using Shadcn UI, a powerful open source
      component library for Next.js, and Tailwind for general layout and
      styling.

    <p>
      In this particular project I explored some AI tools to generate content
      based on Star Wars to portray the store's theme.
